# LRC-UnityPuzzleCore [LRC-UPC]
A WIP Project for Unity GameDev in the Loopring ecosystem. 
Aiming for a foundation to build puzzle-based mini-games where [RedPackets/LRC/etc] are the prize!

Soon this will allow users (via a interface I havent made yet) to create their own game setups and upload redpackets to be won.
