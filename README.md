# LRC-UnityPuzzleCore [LRC-UPC]
A WIP Project for Unity GameDev, for the Loopring/Puzzle Gang community. 
Developing a foundation for those who want to build puzzle-based mini-games in Unity, where [RedPackets/LRC/etc] are the prize!

## Plan/Overview

Soon this will allow users (via a interface I havent made yet) to create their own game sessions and upload redpackets to be won.
